# telegram-AI-timetable-bot

Created for TechFest 2024. A telegram bot using openai API and google calender API. Talk to the telegram bots via text in human language and it will parse the text and create a schedule that can be pushed to google calender. You can talk to the bot just like a friend, without any specific formatting and it will keep updating the planned timetable.
